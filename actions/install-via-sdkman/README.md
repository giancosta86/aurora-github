# install-via-sdkman

Installs the requested SDK using [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/)

## 🃏Example

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: giancosta86/aurora-github/actions/install-sdkman-candidate@v8
    with:
      candidate: java
      version: 23-open
```

## 💡How it works

1. If SDKMAN is not installed, download and install it.

1. Install the requested SDK and append its path to the **PATH** environment variable.

**Please, note**: all the SDKS are installed to `$HOME/.sdkman/candidates`

## ☑️Requirements

- `candidate` must be an identifier belonging to the [list of SDKs](https://sdkman.io/sdks) supported by SDKMAN.

- `version` must be one of the versions supported for the chosen candidate. You can see it by running:

  ```bash
  sdk list <candidate>
  ```

  where `candidate` is the identifier of the required SDK.
