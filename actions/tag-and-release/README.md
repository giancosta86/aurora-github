# tag-and-release

Creates a **Git** tag and a **GitHub** release, from a Git branch named according to [semver](https://semver.org/); by default, it also deletes the current branch.

## Example

This action is designed to be the very last step in a _publication_ workflow:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: PUBLICATION STEP 1

  - uses: PUBLICATION STEP 2

  - uses: PUBLICATION STEP N

  - uses: giancosta86/aurora-github/actions/tag-and-release@v4
```

## Requirements

- this action requires GitHub Actions to have **read/write** permissions on the repository.

- this action will not run on the _default_ branch of the repository.

- the branch name can safely start with `v`, as long as `delete-branch` is **true** (the default), because the tags are created after the deletion of the branch.

- the ones discussed for [detect-branch-version](../detect-branch-version/README.md).

## How it works

1. By default, delete the current Git branch.

1. Create a new tag - for example, `vX.Y.Z` - containing the semantic version inferred from the branch name.

1. Create or draft a GitHub release.

1. Optionally, _create or move_ the tag of the major version related to the current version - for example, `vX`.
