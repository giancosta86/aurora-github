# tag-and-release

Merges a pull request, creates a **Git** tag and publishes a **GitHub** release, from a Git branch named according to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

## 🃏Example

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: giancosta86/aurora-github/actions/tag-and-release@v10
```

It is essential to remember that this action must be called:

- from a workflow **not triggered by a pull request event** - in particular, it should be one _manually triggered_:

  ```yml
  on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  ```

- from a branch _associated with a pull request_ - which can be selected when starting the workflow

The only exception is when `dry-run` is set to **true**.

More generally, this action should be _the very last step_ in a manually-triggered workflow performing _artifact publication_ - so that the pull request gets closed and the related resources released once all the other steps are successful.

## ☑️Requirements

- Unless the `dry-run` input is set to **true**, this action can only be called:

  - **within a workflow not triggered by a pull request**; in particular, it should be invoked from within a **manually-triggered** workflow

  - from a branch **associated with a pull request**; as a corollary, the action _cannot be run from the default branch_.

    Strictly speaking, the pull request **does not have to be open** - in certain situations, you might want to close the pull request via the web interface (for example, to configure the Git merge message) and later run `tag-and-release`, as long as the underlying branch is still available; however, that would defeat the very purpose of the action - which is _closing the pull request at the end of a successful publication pipeline_.

- The following [permission](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/controlling-permissions-for-github_token) must be set for the action to work

  - `contents`: **write**

  It is active by default - but it must be explicitly enabled when other permissions are declared

- Within the **Settings** tab of the project web interface on GitHub, the following **Workflow permissions** must be selected:

  - **Read and write permissions**

- The branch name can safely start with `v` - and it actually should - because the tags are created after the deletion of the branch.

- The requirements discussed for [detect-branch-version](../detect-branch-version/README.md) also apply.

## 💡How it works

1. If the pull request associated with the current branch is open (as it should), merge it - using the selected `git-strategy` for merging/rebasing the code and deleting the branch

1. Create a new tag - for example, `vX.Y.Z` - containing the semantic version inferred from the branch name.

1. Generate the release notes - based on the Git commit list

1. If `notes-file-processor` is not an empty string, it will be interpreted as the filename - relative to `project-directory` - of a **Bash** script that:

   - must take in input (via `$1`) the path of the temporary file containing the generated release notes

   - can arbitrarily alter the content of such file - and even call other interpreters

   - does not need the `#!` prelude, nor the _executable flag_

1. Create or draft a GitHub release.

1. Optionally, _create or move_ the tag of the major version related to the current version - for example, `vX`.
