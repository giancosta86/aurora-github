# upload-release-assets

Uploads one or more asset files to a **GitHub** release.

## Example

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: giancosta86/aurora-github/actions/upload-release-assets@v8
    with:
      release-tag: v3.0.2
      files: logo.png data.zip
      source-directory: dist
```

## How it works

This action calls the [gh release upload](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_release_upload) command to upload the given files.

## Requirements

- The `release-tag` input must be the tag of an existing release - which could be, for example, the `release-tag` output of the [tag-and-release](../tag-and-release/README.md) action.

- The `files` input must be passed just like a string of relative file paths on the Bash command line.
