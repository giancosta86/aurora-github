# verify-npm-package

Verifies the source files of a **NodeJS** package - by running its `verify` script within the `scripts` section of `package.json`.

It is worth noting this action can support any technology - as long as you comply with the requirements described below.

## Example

The action can be placed right after checking out the source code:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4

  - uses: giancosta86/aurora-github/actions/verify-npm-package@v6
```

**IMPORTANT**: please, remember to declare your verification process in the `verify` script within `package.json`! For example:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "vitest",
  "build": "tsc",
  "verify": "pnpm test && pnpm build"
}
```

## How it works

1. Optionally run [check-artifact-version](../check-artifact-version/README.md), to ensure that the artifact version in `package.json` matches the version detected from the name of the current Git branch.

1. Ensure that the package is based on **ESM** - via the `"type": "module"` attribute in `package.json`; this default behavior can be disabled.

1. Install the required NodeJS version, **pnpm** and the dependencies, via [setup-nodejs-context](../setup-nodejs-context/README.md)

1. Run `pnpm verify` - so that the related script in `package.json` can decide what to do.

1. By default, run [check-subpath-exports](../check-subpath-exports/README.md) to verify that the `exports` field in `package.json` actually references existing files.

1. If a **tests** directory exists within `project-directory`, execute [run-custom-tests](../run-custom-tests/README.md) on it, with the `optional` flag enabled; in particular, the `dedicated-env` flag for the called action will be set to the value of the `custom-test-env` input.

   ðŸ’¡The rationale for this step is a parallelism with Rust's **tests** directory - dedicated to verify the crate under test from a _client_ perspective; however, in `verify-npm-package` you have even more fine-grained control over the test process: for example, you can automatically launch _a Bash script_ to test the system, while still relying on the **tests** directory to host utility modules imported by different tests in the **src** directory tree.

   **Please, note**: should you need to execute a shell script for testing, a `verify.sh` script, run by Bash, is required; for further details, please refer to [run-custom-tests](../run-custom-tests/README.md).

1. Find [critical TODOs](../find-critical-todos/README.md) in the source code - which crash the workflow by default.

## Requirements

- The package manager for the project must be [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) - version `9` or later compatible.

- The entire verification process for the package must be triggered by the `verify` script in `package.json` (see the example).

- The root directory of the project must contain a `.nvmrc` file - declaring the required Node.js version - whose format must be compatible with the `actions/setup-node` action (for example: `vX.Y.Z`).

- The requirements for [check-artifact-version](../check-artifact-version/README.md), if `check-artifact-version` is enabled.
